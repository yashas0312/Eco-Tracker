# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EcoTracker Carbon Footprint Analysis System enables individuals to track, monitor, and reduce their personal carbon emissions through comprehensive tracking of vehicle usage, plastic consumption, and tree plantations. The system awards points for eco-friendly actions, particularly tree planting, and provides historical analysis to help users understand their environmental impact over time.

## Glossary

- **EcoTracker System**: The web-based application that tracks and analyzes individual carbon footprint data
- **Carbon Footprint**: The total amount of greenhouse gases (primarily CO2) generated by an individual's actions
- **Eco Points**: Reward points awarded to users for carbon-reducing activities
- **Emission Entry**: A single record of carbon-generating activity (vehicle use, plastic consumption, or energy use)
- **Plantation Entry**: A record of tree planting activity that reduces carbon footprint
- **Historical Dashboard**: The interface displaying past carbon emission trends and improvements
- **Weekly Progress Report**: A summary showing carbon footprint changes over the past weeks
- **User Profile**: An individual account that stores all emission and plantation data

4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display the total current carbon footprint in kilograms of CO2 on the User Profile
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL store each Emission Entry with a timestamp for historical tracking

### Requirement 2: Tree Plantation Tracking and Rewards

**User Story:** As a user who plants trees, I want to log my tree planting activities and earn points, so that I can see how my efforts reduce my carbon footprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User submits a Plantation Entry with number of trees planted, THE EcoTracker System SHALL award 10 Eco Points per tree
2. WHEN the User submits a Plantation Entry, THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate the CO2 offset in kilograms based on average tree absorption rates
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL subtract the CO2 offset from the User's total carbon footprint
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display the total Eco Points earned on the User Profile
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL store each Plantation Entry with a timestamp for historical tracking

### Requirement 3: Vehicle Usage Tracking with Fuel Type Analysis

**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to track my vehicle usage with different fuel types, so that I can understand which transportation choices have the most environmental impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EcoTracker System SHALL support the following fuel types: petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid, and CNG
2. WHEN the User selects a fuel type and enters distance traveled, THE EcoTracker System SHALL apply the appropriate CO2 emission factor per kilometer
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display a breakdown of emissions by fuel type in the Historical Dashboard
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate petrol emissions at 2.31 kilograms CO2 per liter with average consumption of 0.08 liters per kilometer
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate diesel emissions at 2.68 kilograms CO2 per liter with average consumption of 0.07 liters per kilometer

### Requirement 4: Historical Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a user committed to reducing my carbon footprint, I want to view my emission history and weekly improvements, so that I can track my progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display a Historical Dashboard showing carbon emissions for the past 12 weeks
2. WHEN the User views the Historical Dashboard, THE EcoTracker System SHALL display a line chart showing weekly CO2 emissions trends
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate and display the percentage change in emissions compared to the previous week
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display a Weekly Progress Report showing total emissions, total offsets, and net carbon footprint
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL allow the User to filter historical data by activity type: vehicles, plastics, heating, or plantations

### Requirement 5: Visual Design and User Interface

**User Story:** As a user of the EcoTracker application, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface with a green and white color scheme, so that the application reflects its environmental purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EcoTracker System SHALL use a primary color palette of green shades and white for all interface elements
2. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display a navigation menu with sections for Dashboard, Add Entry, History, and Profile
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL use green accent colors for positive actions such as tree planting and emission reductions
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL use visual indicators such as icons for vehicles, plastics, trees, and energy sources
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display all numerical data with appropriate units (kg CO2, points, percentage)

### Requirement 6: Plastic Consumption Tracking

**User Story:** As a consumer concerned about plastic waste, I want to track my plastic usage, so that I can understand its contribution to my carbon footprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EcoTracker System SHALL support tracking of single-use plastics, plastic bottles, plastic bags, and plastic packaging
2. WHEN the User enters plastic consumption with type and quantity, THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate CO2 emissions based on production and disposal impact
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate single-use plastic emissions at 6 kilograms CO2 per kilogram of plastic
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL display total plastic-related emissions separately in the User Profile
5. THE EcoTracker System SHALL provide suggestions for reducing plastic consumption when emissions exceed 5 kilograms CO2 per week

### Requirement 7: Household Energy Tracking

**User Story:** As a homeowner, I want to track my heating energy consumption, so that I can understand its impact on my carbon footprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EcoTracker System SHALL support tracking of natural gas, electricity, heating oil, and coal as heating energy sources
2. WHEN the User enters energy consumption with source type and amount in kilowatt-hours, THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate CO2 emissions
3. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate natural gas emissions at 0.18 kilograms CO2 per kilowatt-hour
4. THE EcoTracker System SHALL calculate electricity emissions at 0.42 kilograms CO2 per kilowatt-hour based on grid average
5. WHERE the User has renewable energy sources, THE EcoTracker System SHALL allow marking entries as renewable with zero emissions

### Requirement 8: Data Persistence and User Sessions

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want my carbon footprint data to be saved and accessible across sessions, so that I can track my long-term progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria
